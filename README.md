# Heart-Disease-Failure-Prediction
Made a model which Predicted whether a person with given health condition would have heart failure or not. The model was trained on a dataset universally available. Exploratory data analysis was applied to the dataset to remove the outliers . Also applied deep learning techniques to build a neural network and tested its accuracy on the dataset.
